# Release Notes - v1.0.2

## 🎨 Sleek & Premium UI Overhaul
Ginger's interface has been redesigned with a focus on aesthetics and usability, moving towards a high-end, futuristic look.

- **Glassmorphism Design**: All UI panels (Title Bar, Sidebar, and Controls) now feature a sophisticated glass effect with advanced backdrop blurring and subtle, semi-transparent borders.
- **Premium Dark Mode**: Refined the color palette to a "Midnight" deep black (`#030303`) with curated `#e5e7eb` text for maximum contrast and elegance.
- **Micro-Animations**: Added smooth fade-in transitions for panels and a new, more energetic animation for the music visualizer in the queue.
- **Dynamic 3D Background**: Tuned the integrated 3D background to synchronize with the new design language.
- **New Placeholder Stage**: A premium "Ready for Music" center stage with glowing effects and refined iconography for when no track is playing.

## 📐 Expandable & Collapsible Queue
Maximum screen real estate when you want it, full control when you need it.

- **Sliding Sidebar**: The Playlist Sidebar is now dynamic. Use the new list icon in the navigation or playback controls to slide it in and out of view.
- **Improved Queue Items**: Track items in the queue now feature a "Glass Card" design when active, providing clear visual feedback and a more organized feel.

## 🖥️ Enhanced Playback Experience
- **Native Full Screen**: A new dedicated full-screen button in the playback controls allows you to immerse yourself in your media with a single click.
- **Refined Controls**: Re-imagined the playback control bar with better spacing, updated icons, and a more intuitive, hover-sensitive volume control.
- **Progress Tracking**: Smoother progress bar transitions with a glow indicator.

## 🚀 Automatic Background Updates
We've made the update process completely frictionless.

- **Background Auto-Download**: Updates now download silently in the background using `electron-updater`.
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Ginger will notify you only when an update is fully ready to be installed, allowing for a one-click "Restart and Update" experience.
